			<p>Computing is part of everything we do. Such as, expertise in computing enables you to solve complex, challenging problems. Computing drives innovation in the sciences, engineering and business:- Like the human genome project, AIDS vaccine research, environmental monitoring and protection. Computer science is challenging, and yet dynamic. It requires people in the field to be keep learning and pushing the limit. That fast-pacing innovation of technology never stops amazing me, which excites my innate curiosity even more. I, however, had never thought about pursuing computer science as a career until I took an introductory class in my college year. It sparked my interest and changed my thoughts after seeing what I could do with some simple line of codes. Despite of many countless times sitting in front of the computer screen trying out figure how to do solve a problem, those "Aha" moments were more precious and exciting for me. These experiences slowly pull me into the course of a new career, computer science. Pursuing a degree in this field can provide me knowledge and skills and along with my passion to bring changes to people's daily lives starting from mobile application. I want to be a part of this evolution of technology.</p>
